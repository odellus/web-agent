# ACP Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

The Agent Client Protocol (ACP) integration for web-agent has been successfully implemented, providing a standardized "LSP for AI coding agents" that enables seamless integration with Zed editor and other ACP-compatible tools.

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Core Protocol Components

**📦 Protocol Layer (`src/web_agent/ACP/protocol/`)**
- `types.py` - Complete ACP type definitions and schemas following the 0.4.0 specification
- `methods.py` - Full ACP method implementations (initialize, session/*, tools/*)
- `sessions.py` - Robust session management with lifecycle and cleanup
- `streaming.py` - NDJSON streaming utilities for real-time communication

**🔌 Integration Adapters (`src/web_agent/ACP/adapters/`)**
- `langgraph_adapter.py` - Seamless integration with existing LangGraph agent
- `tool_adapter.py` - Bridge between ACP tool interface and web-agent tools

**🛠️ Utilities (`src/web_agent/ACP/utils/`)**
- `json_rpc.py` - JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol processing with proper error handling
- `ndjson.py` - NDJSON streaming for efficient line-by-line communication

### Server & Client Infrastructure

**🌐 Server (`src/web_agent/ACP/server.py`)**
- Dual-mode support: WebSocket (development) and stdio (production)
- FastAPI-based WebSocket server for real-time communication
- Stdio server for Zed editor integration
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**📡 Client (`src/web_agent/ACP/client.py`)**
- Stdio client optimized for Zed integration
- High-level ACPStdioClient for easy usage
- Interactive mode for testing and development

## 🔧 Key Features

### ACP Protocol Compliance
- ✅ Full JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation
- ✅ NDJSON streaming for real-time updates
- ✅ Proper error codes and handling
- ✅ Session management with timeout and cleanup
- ✅ Capability negotiation

### Agent Integration
- ✅ Seamless LangGraph agent integration
- ✅ All 4 core tools supported (bash, edit, sequential_thinking, task_done)
- ✅ Working directory context preservation
- ✅ Tool validation and execution
- ✅ Streaming agent responses

### Transport Support
- ✅ WebSocket server for development/testing
- ✅ Stdio transport for Zed production use
- ✅ Configurable host, port, and working directory
- ✅ Graceful shutdown and error recovery

## 🚀 Usage

### Zed Editor Integration

Add to Zed `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "web-agent": {
      "command": ["python", "-m", "web_agent.ACP"],
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio", "--working-dir", "{workspace}"],
      "transport": "stdio",
      "capabilities": {
        "fs": {"readTextFile": true, "writeTextFile": true},
        "terminal": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# WebSocket server for testing
python -m web_agent.ACP --transport websocket --port 8095

# Stdio server for production
python -m web_agent.ACP --transport stdio --working-dir /path/to/project
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run integration tests
PYTHONPATH=src python tests/test_acp_integration.py

# View capabilities and setup
PYTHONPATH=src python demo_acp_info.py
```

## 📊 Architecture

```
Zed Editor ←→ ACP Protocol ←→ Web-Agent
     ↓              ↓                ↓
  stdio/WS    JSON-RPC 2.0    LangGraph
  transport    NDJSON          Agent
              Streaming        Tools
```

### Component Flow
1. **Protocol Layer**: Handles ACP specification compliance
2. **Adapters**: Bridge between ACP and existing systems
3. **Server**: Provides transport-agnostic ACP service
4. **Client**: Enables editor integration

## 🧪 Testing Results

All integration tests pass successfully:
- ✅ ACP initialization
- ✅ Session creation and management
- ✅ Tools listing (4 tools available)
- ✅ Tool execution (bash, edit, thinking, task_done)
- ✅ JSON-RPC message processing
- ✅ Complete workflow end-to-end
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

## 📋 Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `bash_tool` | Execute shell commands with working directory support | `{"command": "ls -la"}` |
| `edit_tool` | File operations (view, create, edit) | `{"command": "view", "file_path": "README.md"}` |
| `sequential_thinking_tool` | Structured problem-solving and reasoning | `{"thought": "Analyze problem...", "thought_number": 1, "total_thoughts": 5}` |
| `task_done` | Signal task completion with verification | `{}` |
